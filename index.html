        <h3>Freshman</h3>
        <p>I hope to learn a little glimpse of UI/UX Design and basic developer code. As a graphic design major, that's something I'm also very interested in. I love design as a whole and I like to learn more than just my chosen field.</p>
        <h4>My Favorite Things</h4>
        <p>A hobby I have developed over a course of 5 years is Henna. I continuously improve my henna skills and enjoy my time doing it for others. Another thing I really love is creating designs on illustrator. Although I'm, pretty new to it, I have the basic skillset to create/replicate basic designs. I would also like to share that I absolutely love traveling and have been doing it all my life!</p>
