        <h3>What is the hype on Filter Kaapi?</h3>
        <p>Traditionally, Indian filter coffee is a milk-based beverage, similar to a café latte. Over time, it has been known by various names such as filter coffee, degree coffee, Mysore filter coffee, or Kumbakonam coffee, and was a household staple in South India long before café chains serving lattes and mochas became popular in urban India.
